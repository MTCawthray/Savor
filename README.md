## Overview
+ Amateur home cooks crave outlets to find new and exciting recipes, and as it tends to play out, they rely on these staple recipes to get them fed through the work week! Savor is an app that allows a user to search a wide range of recipes to try out in their own kitchen. When they find a recipe that hits the spot, they can easily save it to the 'My Recipe' section for use on a busy weeknight down the road, thus saving them the time it takes to consider, "Where did I find that recipe I liked a few weeks ago??"
